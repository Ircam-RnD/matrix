/**
 * [client] Synchronize the local clock on a master clock shared by the server and the clients.
 *
 * Both the clients and the server can use this master clock as a common time reference.
 * For instance, this allows all the clients to do something exactly at the same time, such as blinking the screen or playing a sound in a synchronized manner.
 *
 * The module always has a view (that displays "Clock syncing, stand byâ€¦", until the very first synchronization process is done).
 *
 * The module finishes its initialization as soon as the client clock is in sync with the master clock.
 * Then, the synchronization process keeps running in the background to resynchronize the clocks from times to times.
 *
 * **Note:** the service is based on [`github.com/collective-soundworks/sync`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/sync).
 *
 * (See also {@link src/server/ServerSync.js~ServerSync} on the server side.)
 *
 * @example
 * const sync = serviceManager.require('service:sync');
 *
 * const nowLocal = sync.getLocalTime(); // current time in local clock time
 * const nowSync = sync.getSyncTime(); // current time in sync clock time
 * @emits 'sync:stats' each time the module (re)synchronizes the local clock on the sync clock.
 * The `'status'` event goes along with the `report` object that has the following properties:
 * - `timeOffset`, current estimation of the time offset between the client clock and the sync clock;
 * - `travelTime`, current estimation of the travel time for a message to go from the client to the server and back;
 * - `travelTimeMax`, current estimation of the maximum travel time for a message to go from the client to the server and back.
