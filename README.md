## Documentation

[http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/](http://collective-soundworks.github.io/soundworks/)

## Overview

`soundworks` follows a client / server architecture where the server is written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and clients can be either regular browser clients but also Node.js clients running for example on a Raspberry Pi.

The core of the framework is very minimal and doing the basic initialisation stuff:
  - creating http(s) server
  - opening sockets
  - handling initialization
  
`soundworks` can be extended with services to reuse common logic such as audio file loading, clock synchronisation, etc. Each service leaves in a separate repo for better modularity and simplify version management.

## Installation

```
npm install @soundworks/core
```

## Application Template

The simplest way to start a new `soundworks` application is using the application template [https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-template](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-template).
